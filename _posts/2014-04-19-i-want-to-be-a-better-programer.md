title: I want to be a better programer

We're Saturday morning, 8:43AM, and I'm typing this after yet an other (too) delicious breakfast at my airbnb place.

> I want to be a better programmer.

That's what I had in my head when I woke up this morning. Devoxx ended yesterday and I [didn't enjoy it that much]({% post_url 2014-04-18-devoxx-day3 %}). But as I said in my conclusion, the benefit of this conference is that it motivated me, pushed me to my keyboard. I realize the reason is that I want to be like these guys on stage. I want to use and talk about these new cool technologies, I want to be more efficient at what I do. (I want to be famous and recognized in the coridors of the conference?).

# I need to train and practice.

Since this idea came to mind, thousands of others joined in. I've created a movie, imagining some scenes about what is supposed to happen next, what I'll do and say, how I'll handle this project. That's what happens to me when I start thinking about something new and fun, and it is usually a good sign. But it is a long journey and we'll see, it may as well stop in 5 minutes, so let's be lean.

 I wrote it down, and no one will read this, unless I actually give this project a chance. We'll see what happens on Monday. And in the meantime, let's go and enjoy this last day in Paris.
