My deadline. 

Monday was a holiday, but today was supposed to be my first post.

Indeed, the idea is to use this blog to push me to discover and then write about things I've learned and experienced.

Procrastination was doing a good job, it is now 10PM. But it worked: the totally virtual peer pressure pushed me to write these lines.

Being overly optimistic, I'll try to post every week day. We'll see how it goes. That's about 200 posts in a year. If I learn half as many tricks, I'll be a [better programmer]({% post_url 2014-04-19-i-want-to-be-a-better-programer %}).

# It's already working

Since I started this blog, I've been playing with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), the [Markdown syntax](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and [GitHub user pages](https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages), among other things (such as forcing myself to write in English).

These are fantastic tools, and I'm glad I have added these to my tool belt.

Let's see what we'll talk about tomorrow.
