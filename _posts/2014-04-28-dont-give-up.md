`Bash` brings you back to [the seventies]({% post_url 2014-04-24-back-to-the-seventies %}). I've fought a couple more hours to get `curl` working, changing the different types of quotes I use, with no real success.

I've started wrting a python meta-script, that would generate the bash script (pure curl calls, no functions, to mitigate quote problems). Then I looked at [restAssured](https://code.google.com/p/rest-assured/) in Java, but the syntax is not as fluent as they claim.

And then I decided to stop.

That's one of the most important lessons I need to learn. When there's a problem, and you can spend hours solving it, using your programmer's skills, well, you don't have to. It's not a failure, it's an optimization of my time and happiness. It's not cowardice, it's wisdom. Sort of (it's still hard to admit).
